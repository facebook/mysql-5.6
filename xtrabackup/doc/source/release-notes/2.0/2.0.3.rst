============================

Percona is glad to announce the release of Percona XtraBackup 2.0.3 on October 1st, 2012. Downloads are available from our download site `here <http://www.percona.com/downloads/XtraBackup/XtraBackup-2.0.3/>`_ and :doc:`Percona Software Repositories </installation>`.

This release is the current GA (Generally Available) stable release in the 2.0 series. 

New Features
=============
  
  * |innobackupex| now supports new :option:`--move-back` option that can be used instead of :option:`--copy-back` in case there isn't enough free disk space on the server to copy files. As this option removes backup files, it must be used with caution.
 
Bugs Fixed
==========

  * Symlink for ``innobackupex-1.5.1`` binary has been broken in the previous version of |XtraBackup|. Bug fixed :bug:`1038198` (*Ignacio Nin*).

  * |XtraBackup| 2.0.2 was not backwards compatible which caused incremental backups created with previous versions to fail on prepare. Bug fixed :bug:`1038127` (*Sergei Glushchenko*).

  * Fix for bug :bug:`1022562` introduced a regression that may potentially lead to a 5x increase in disk space occupied by incremental backups. Bug fixed :bug:`1043762` (*Laurynas Biveinis*).

  * A regression was introduced in fix for bug :bug:`932623` which caused incorrect handling of compressed tablespaces with the page size of 16K, that were created between the last full or incremental and the next incremental backup. Bugs fixed :bug:`1049174` and :bug:`1044398` (*Laurynas Biveinis*).
