Do I need an InnoDB Hot Backup license to use XtraBackup?
=========================================================

No. Although ``innobackupex`` is derived from the same GPL and open-source wrapper script that InnoDB Hot Backup uses, it does not execute ``ibbackup``, and the ``xtrabackup`` binary does not execute or link to ``ibbackup``. You can use XtraBackup without any license; it is completely separate from InnoDB Hot Backup.

Why is innobackupex distributed as innobackupex-1.5.1?
======================================================

That's the way the source for the tool was distributed from Oracle. Nowadays, it is a symbolic link to |innobackupex| for backward compatibility with |XtraBackup|.

What's the difference between :program:`innobackupex` and :program:`innobackup`?
================================================================================

Because :program:`innobackupex` is a patched version of *Oracle* â€™s :program:`innobackup` script (now renamed to :program:`mysqlbackup`), it is quite similar in some ways, and familiarity with innobackup might be helpful.

Despite the options for specific features of |innobackupex|, the main differences are:

  * printing to ``STDERR`` instead of ``STDOUT`` (which enables the :option:`--stream` option), 

  * the configuration file - :term:`my.cnf` - is detected automatically (or setted with :option:`innobackupex --defaults-file`) instead of the mandotory first argument,

  * and defaults to |xtrabackup| as binary to use in the :option:`--ibbackup`.

..  * Ssleep and compress?

See :doc:`innobackupex/innobackupex_option_reference` for more details.


Why the :program:`xtrabackup` binary doesn't makes a "full backup" of the database? Should I use :program:`innobackupex` always?
================================================================================================================================

:program:`xtrabackup` is a C program written to take advantage of the InnoDB or XtraDB features in order to make it as fast, less resource-consuming and unobtrusive (locking the database server) as possible. That is only possible with those engines. In the case of MyISAM a "write lock" is needed.

:program:`innobackupex` is a script written in Perl which wraps :program:`xtrabackup` and other backup tools (such as :program:`tar4ibd`) and provides you with the functionality of each tool taking care of the details.

However, for some specific tasks, you must use :program:`xtrabackup` directly. See the :ref:`user-manual` for details on each one.

Are you aware of any web-based backup management tools (commercial or not) built around |Xtrabackup|?
=====================================================================================================

`Zmanda Recovery Manager <http://www.zmanda.com/zrm-mysql-enterprise.html>`_ is a commercial tool that uses XtraBackup for Non-Blocking Backups: *"ZRM provides support for
non-blocking backups of MySQL using XtraBackup. ZRM with XtraBackup
provides resource utilization management by providing throttling based
on the number of IO operations per second. XtraBackup based backups also
allow for table level recovery even though the backup was done at the
database level (needs the recovery database server to be Percona Server
with XtraDB)."*

|xtrabackup| binary fails with a floating point exception
=========================================================

In most of the cases this is due to not having install the required libraries (and version) by |xtrabackup|. Installing the *GCC* suite with the supporting libraries and recompiling |xtrabackup| will solve the issue. See :doc:`installation/compiling_xtrabackup` for instructions on the procedure.

How innobackupex handles the ibdata/ib_log files on restore if they aren't in mysql datadir?
============================================================================================

In case the ibdata and ib_log files are located in different directories outside of the datadir, you will have to put them in their proper place after the logs have been applied.
