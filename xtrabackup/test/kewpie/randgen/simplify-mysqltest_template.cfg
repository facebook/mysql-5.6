{

# base_dir
#---------
# Directory where your MySQL release is installed.
#
# If you want to simplify based on result differences between two server versions
# instead of looking for expected output from a single server, specify both
# basedir and basedir2 below.
#
# Unless you are looking for an assertion, use a non-debug build for faster processing
#

    basedir => '/build/bzr/mysql-5.1-rep+3',

# input_file
#-----------
# File which should be used as the base for the simplification process.
# This could be a
# - script (extension .test) for processing via mysq-ltest-run.pl
# - statement log (extension .CSV)
#   Example: <basedir>/var/master-data/mysql/general_log.CSV
#

    input_file => '/tmp/general_log.CSV',

# expected_mtr_output
#--------------------
# Pattern which needs to occur within the MTR output after a successful
# simplification. The search pattern is usually derived from a backtrace.
# Not needed if two basedirs (servers) are specified (file comparison is used
# instead).
#
# Some hints:
# "."   matches any character including newline (the search command uses the "s" modifier)
# "{<min>,<max>}"   Minimum match count <min> , Maximum match count <max>
# So the example pattern causes basically a search for
# "safe_cond_timedwait" with a distance of less than 151 characters to a following
# "thr_mutex.c" with a distance of less than 51 characters to a following ...
# Example:
#   'safe_cond_timedwait.{0,150}thr_mutex\.c.{0,50}Item_func_sleep::val_int.{0,3000}SELECT 1,SLEEP\(10\)',
#

    expected_mtr_output => 'HA_ERR_END_OF_FILE',

# Please be careful when using addresses or source file line numbers in search patterns.
# - They increase the selectivity of the search.
# - A minor change of the server startup options, source files etc. could cause that the search fails.

# header
#-------
# The header is prepended to each test case and is not influenced by simplification.
# If replication is enabled, --source include/master-slave.inc will also be used.

	'--disable_result_log'
    ],

# footer
#-------
# The footer is appended to each test case and is not influenced by simplification.
# When replication is enabled, the default footer is '--sync_slave_with_master'
# If you are simplifying a crashing bug, you can also put your crashing query here
#

    footer => [
#	'--connection master',
#	'--sync_slave_with_master',			# Enable this for replication

#	'--let $diff_table_1 = master:test.table1_int',
#	'--let $diff_table_2 = slave:test.table1_int',
#	'--source include/diff_tables.inc',
    ],

# filter
#-------
# The filter is applied to the test case in order to remove irrelevant queries. If 
# you are running a replication test, you may also wish to filter out SELECTs
#

    filter => qr{SHOW WARNINGS|EXPLAIN}sio,

# mtr_options
#------------
# mysql-test-run.pl (MTR) options which should be used.
# 'record' is required if two basedirs (servers) are specified.

# Multithreaded test cases
#-------------------------
#
# Enabling this option will use --connection --connect and --disconnect
# when converting the CSV file into a .test case. This however may cause
# considerable slow-down in the simplification process because MTR will
# constantly complain about mismatched --connection and --connect in the
# intermediate test cases.
