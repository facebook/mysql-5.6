How to obtain data sets for GIS testing
=======================================

The datasets from the OpenStreetMap project can be converted into
LINESTRINGs compatible with MySQL and PostGIS as follows:

1. Use the software at

http://www.tm.kit.edu/~mayer/osm2wkt/

to convert an OpenStreetMap XML to WKT, or use one of the existing WKT
files on that site.

2. Pipe the WKT file through the conf/gis/wkt2sql.pl script to obtain SQL:

perl conf/gis/wkt2sql.pl [MySQL|PostGIS] < venice.wkt > venice.sql
