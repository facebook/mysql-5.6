{

# desired_status_codes
#---------------------
# List of expected status codes.
# Status codes are described in lib/GenTest/Constants.pm
# STATUS_ANY_ERROR means that any RQG error would cause the
# simplification to continue, e.g. both deadlocks and crashes will be
# considered together.
#
    desired_status_codes => [+STATUS_ANY_ERROR],

# expected_output
#----------------
# List of string patterns which all need to occur within the RQG output
# after a successful simplification. The search patterns are usually
# derived from a backtrace.
# Example 1:
#   Starting point is a crash of a server which was compiled with debug.
#    expected_output =>
#    [
#      'assert.{0,150}safe_cond_timedwait.{0,150}thr_mutex\.c.{0,50}Item_func_sleep::val_int.{0,3000}SELECT 1,SLEEP\(10\)'
#    ];
#   Please be careful when using source file line numbers or addresses
#   in search patterns
#   - They increase the selectivity of the search.
#   - There is a significant risk that they do no more fit if the source
#     code of the server gets changed.
# Example 2:
#   Starting point is a crash of a server which was compiled without debug.
#    expected_output => [
#       '0x0000000000413f61',
#       '0x00000000004429a0',
#       '0x0000000000453f0f'
#    ]
#    Just some adresses looks ugly but it works quite good.
# Example 3:
#   If just hunt for some status code ( -> desired_status_codes ) use
#    expected_output => [ '' ]
#

   expected_output => [
      ''
   ],

# initial_grammar_file
#---------------------
# File which should be used as the base for the simplification process.

   initial_grammar_file => 'conf/runtime/WL5004_sql.yy',

# rqg_options
#------------
# runall.pl (RQG) options which should be used

   rqg_options => {
      basedir  => '/work2/6.0/mysql-6.0-codebase-bugfixing1/',
      threads  => 30,
      queries  => 3000,
      duration => 60,
      mysqld => {

         'innodb-lock-wait-timeout' => 1,

# grammar_flags
#--------------
# Set "grammar_flags" to GRAMMAR_FLAG_COMPACT_RULES so that rules such
# as rule: a | a | a | a | a | a | b are compressed to rule: a | b
# before simplification. This will speed up the process as each
# instance of "a" will not be removed separately until they are all
# gone.

   grammar_flags => +GRAMMAR_FLAG_COMPACT_RULES,

# trials
#-------
# This is the number of times the oracle() will run the RQG in order to get to
# the desired status code and/or desired strings (expected_output).
# If the error is sporadic, several runs may be required to know if the bug
# is still present in the simplified grammar or not.
# The "seed" value gets incremented per trial.

    trials => 1,

# search_var_size
#----------------
# Number of bytes (counted from the end of the output file) to be used during
# search for expected_output We suck the last "search_var_size" Bytes of the file
# to be searched into a variable.
# A too huge "search_var_size" could cause problems.
# The relevant zone within the file is maybe
# - smaller
#   If our search pattern is unfortunately a bit unspecific and if it
#   could also occur within irrelevant zones of the file than we might
#   get false positives. Decreasing "search_var_size" might help.
# - bigger
#   We might get false negatives. Increasing "search_var_size" might
#   help but I am unsure if any OS and PERL implementation supports
#   such a monstrous variable.

    search_var_size => 3000000,

# initial_seed
#-------------
# Initial seed value to use. This increases the likelihood that the RQG run
# with the initial grammar reaches the desired result.

    initial_seed => 852,

# vardir_prefix
#---------------
# "Server activity" should happen in "vardir" which is a subdirecty of
# "vardir_prefix".
# Important points are:
# - free space within the filesystem
# - performance of the filesystem
# Simplification gets a significant speed up if we could use a memory
# based filesystem.

    vardir_prefix => '/dev/shm',

# storage_prefix
#---------------
# Grammars and logs of the simplification process get stored within a
# subdirectory of "storage_prefix".

    storage_prefix => './storage'
