Many people have graciously sent me configuration
files and other useful tidbits for use with libarchive.

I do not support or use any of these; but if you can use them, enjoy!

libarchive_autodetect-st_lib_archive.m4

M4 macros for use with autoconf to detect whether a suitable
version of libarchive is installed on this system.

libarchive.spec

An RPM ".spec" file for building libarchive on most systems.
This apparently was originally developed by a group at pld-linux.org.
Several people have sent me different versions of this file.

As above, for use on AIX5.3.
