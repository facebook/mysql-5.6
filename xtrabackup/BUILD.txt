How to build XtraBackup on Linux
================================

Prerequisites
-------------

The following packages and tools must be installed to compile 
Percona XtraBackup from source. These might vary from system to system.

In Debian-based distributions, you need to:

  $ apt-get install build-essential flex bison automake autoconf bzr \
    libtool cmake libaio-dev mysql-client libncurses-dev zlib1g-dev

In RPM-based distributions, you need to:

  $ yum install cmake gcc gcc-c++ libaio libaio-devel automake autoconf bzr \
    bison libtool ncurses5-devel

Compiling with build.sh
-----------------------

Once you have all dependencies met, the compilation is straight-forward with 
the bundled build.sh script in the utils/ directory of the distribution.

The script needs the codebase for which the building is targeted, you must
provide it with one of the following values or aliases:

  ================== =========  =============================================
  Value              Alias      Server
  ================== =========  =============================================
  innodb51_builtin   5.1	build against built-in InnoDB in MySQL 5.1
  innodb51           plugin	build against InnoDB plugin in MySQL 5.1
  innodb55           5.5	build against InnoDB in MySQL 5.5
  xtradb51           xtradb     build against Percona Server with XtraDB 5.1
  xtradb55           xtradb55   build against Percona Server with XtraDB 5.5
  innodb56           5.6        build against InnoDB in MySQL 5.6
  ================== =========  =============================================

Note that the script must be executed from the base directory of Xtrabackup 
sources, and that directory must contain the packages with the source code of 
the codebase selected. This may appear cumbersome, but if the variable
AUTO_DOWNLOAD="yes" is set, the build.sh script will download all the source 
code needed for the build.

At the base directory of the downloaded source code, if you execute

  $ AUTO_DOWNLOAD="yes" ./utils/build.sh xtradb

and you go for a coffee, at your return XtraBackup will be ready to be used.
The xtrabackup binary will located in the "percona-xtrabackup/src" subdirectory.

After this you'll need to copy innobackupex and the corresponding xtrabackup
binary to some directory listed in the PATH environment variable, e.g. /usr/bin.
