The following instruction is for setting up a two-node replication stack on the same machine

The instruction is mainly based on the following web link:

https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-master-slave-replication-in-mysql

The web page also has been saved as a PDF file "How To Set Up Master Slave Replication in MySQL.pdf"

Besides following the noted instruction, the following items are important:

1) Both master and slave are setup on the same machine, using the same MySQL installation
2) Master uses port 3306, slave uses 3307
3) If you copy a sample database for both master and slave to use, you will get this error
   when showing slave status:
   
   Errno: 1593 Fatal error: The slave I/O thread stops because master and slave 
   have equal MySQL server UUIDs; these UUIDs must be different for replication to work.
   
   The cause for this error is that both master and slave databases have the same UUID,
   which is stored in the data_dir/auto.cnf file.  To solve the issue, please do
   a) stop the slave server
   b) edit the data_dir/auto.cnf and remove the server-uuid entry and save the file
   c) start the slave server, a new UUID will be automatically generated
   
The following script can be used to build the MySQL binary and have the defaults
databases and cnf files setup

/home/qa/rdb/sh/setupRepMasterSlave.sh


The master and slave will be using port 3306 and 3307, respectively.

Startup both master and slave

On the master, execute:

GRANT REPLICATION SLAVE ON *.* TO 'slave_user'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

restart master

On the slave

The value for both MASAER_LOG_FILE and MASTER_LOG_POS can be obtained by executing the
following command on the master:

show master status;

CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_HOST='localhost',MASTER_USER='slave_user', MASTER_PASSWORD='password', MASTER_LOG_FILE='mysql-bin.000004', MASTER_LOG_POS=  403;

To start master:

  ./mysqld --defaults-file=/home/myrocks/rocksdb/testdb/testMaster.cnf

To start slave:

  ./mysqld --defaults-file=/home/myrocks/rocksdb/testdb/testSlave1.cnf

./mysql -u root --port=3306 --socket=/tmp/testMaster.sock
./mysql -u root --port=3307 --socket=/tmp/testSlave1.sock
