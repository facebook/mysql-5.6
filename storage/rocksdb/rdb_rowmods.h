  A storage for rows, or their tombstones. One can use rocksdb-like iterators
  to traverse the rows.

  == Relationship with Column Families ==
  There is only one Row_table object that stores rows from all Column Families.
  We rely on the fact that no two rows have the same key, even if they are in
  different column families.

  The rows store pointer to their RDBSE_KEYDEF, one can find out which Column
  Family the row is from by calling Row_table_iter::keydef().

  == Forward/backward ordered CFs ==
  We use two trees - one for rows from forward-ordered CFs, and one for rows
  from backward-ordered CFs.

  (we could theoretically use a separate tree for each CF, but TREE stucture is
   too heavy for this.

   I've also considered a solution where both forward an backward-ordered data
   is kept in the same tree. We could compare by index_no first, and then
   compare the remainder in either forward or reverse sorting. This defines an
   ordering sufficient for TREE object to operate, but causes difficult issues
   at table start/end.
