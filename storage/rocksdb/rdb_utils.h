  Introduce C-style namespaces, a handy way to make code more readble when
  calling into a legacy API, which does not have any namespace defined.
  Since we cannot or don't want to change the API in any way, we can use this
  mechanism to define readability tokens that look like C++ namespaces, but are
  not enforced in any way by the compiler, since the pre-compiler strips them
  out. However, on the calling side, code looks like my_core::thd_ha_data()
  rather than plain a thd_ha_data() call. This technique adds an immediate
  visible cue on what type of API we are calling into.

/*
  The intent behind a SHIP_ASSERT() macro is to have a mechanism for validating
  invariants in retail builds. Traditionally assertions (such as macros defined
  in <cassert>) are evaluated for performance reasons only in debug builds and
  become NOOP in retail builds when NDEBUG is defined.

  This macro is intended to validate the invariants which are critical for
  making sure that data corruption and data loss won't take place. Proper
  intended usage can be described as "If a particular condition is not true then
  stop everything what's going on and terminate the process because continued
  execution will cause really bad things to happen".

  Use the power of SHIP_ASSERT() wisely.
