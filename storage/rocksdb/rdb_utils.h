  Introduce C-style pseudo-namespaces, a handy way to make code more readble
  when calling into a legacy API, which does not have any namespace defined.
  Since we cannot or don't want to change the API in any way, we can use this
  mechanism to define readability tokens that look like C++ namespaces, but are
  not enforced in any way by the compiler, since the pre-compiler strips them
  out. However, on the calling side, code looks like my_core::thd_ha_data()
  rather than plain a thd_ha_data() call. This technique adds an immediate
  visible cue on what type of API we are calling into.
