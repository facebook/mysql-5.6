  @note
  This function may be called while not holding the mutex that is used to wait
  on the condition variable.

  The manual page says ( http://linux.die.net/man/3/pthread_cond_signal):

  The pthread_cond_broadcast() or pthread_cond_signal() functions may be called
  by a thread whether or not it currently owns the mutex that threads calling
  pthread_cond_wait() or pthread_cond_timedwait() have associated with the
  condition variable during their waits; however, IF PREDICTABLE SCHEDULING
  BEHAVIOR IS REQUIRED, THEN THAT MUTEX SHALL BE LOCKED by the thread calling
  pthread_cond_broadcast() or pthread_cond_signal().

  What's "predicate scheduling" and do we need it? The explanation is here:

  https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=ky#!msg/comp.programming.threads/wEUgPq541v8/ZByyyS8acqMJ
  "The problem (from the realtime side) with condition variables is that
  if you can signal/broadcast without holding the mutex, and any thread
  currently running can acquire an unlocked mutex and check a predicate
  without reference to the condition variable, then you can have an
  indirect priority inversion."

  Another possible consequence is that one can create spurious wake-ups when
  there are multiple threads signaling the condition.

  None of this looks like a problem for our use case.
