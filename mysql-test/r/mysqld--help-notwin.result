The following options may be given as the first argument:
--print-defaults Print the program argument list and exit.
--no-defaults Don't read default options from any option file,
 except for login file.
--defaults-file=# Only read default options from the given file #.
--defaults-extra-file=# Read this file after the global files are read.
--defaults-group-suffix=#
 Also read groups with concat(group, suffix)
--login-path=# Read this path from the login file.

 --abort-slave-event-count=# 
 Option used by mysql-test for debugging and testing of
 replication.
 --activate-all-roles-on-login 
 Automatically set all granted roles as active after the
 user has authenticated successfully.
 --admin-address=name 
 IP address to bind to for service connection. Address can
 be an IPv4 address, IPv6 address, or host name. Wildcard
 values *, ::, 0.0.0.0 are not allowed. Address value can
 have following optional network namespace separated by
 the delimiter / from the address value. E.g., the
 following value 192.168.1.1/red specifies IP addresses to
 listen for incoming TCP connections that have to be
 placed into the namespace 'red'. Using of network
 namespace requires its support from underlying Operating
 System. Attempt to specify a network namespace for a
 platform that doesn't support it results in error during
 socket creation.
 --admin-port=#      Port number to use for service connection, built-in
 default (33062)
 --admission-control-by-trx 
 Allow open transactions to go through admission control
 --admission-control-filter=name 
 Commands that are skipped in admission control checks.
 The legal values are: ALTER, BEGIN, COMMIT, CREATE,
 DELETE, DROP, INSERT, LOAD, SELECT, SET, REPLACE,
 ROLLBACK, TRUNCATE, UPDATE, SHOW and empty string
 --admission-control-queue-timeout[=#] 
 Number of milliseconds to wait on admission control
 queue. 0 means immediate timeout. -1 means infinite
 timeout.
 --allow-noncurrent-db-rw=name 
 Switch to allow/deny reads and writes to a table not in
 the current database.
 --allow-suspicious-udfs 
 Allows use of UDFs consisting of only one symbol xxx()
 without corresponding xxx_init() or xxx_deinit(). That
 also means that one can load any function from any
 library, for example exit() from libc.so
 -a, --ansi          Use ANSI SQL syntax instead of MySQL syntax. This mode
 will also set transaction isolation level 'serializable'.
 --auto-increment-increment[=#] 
 Auto-increment columns are incremented by this
 --auto-increment-offset[=#] 
 Offset added to Auto-increment columns. Used when
 auto-increment-increment != 1
 --autocommit        Set default value for autocommit (0 or 1)
 (Defaults to on; use --skip-autocommit to disable.)
 --automatic-sp-privileges 
 Creating and dropping stored procedures alters ACLs
 (Defaults to on; use --skip-automatic-sp-privileges to disable.)
 --avoid-temporal-upgrade 
 When this option is enabled, the pre-5.6.4 temporal types
 are not upgraded to the new format for ALTER TABLE
 requests ADD/CHANGE/MODIFY COLUMN, ADD INDEX or FORCE
 operation. This variable is deprecated and will be
 removed in a future release.
 --back-log=#        The number of outstanding connection requests MySQL can
 have. This comes into play when the main MySQL thread
 gets very many connection requests in a very short time
 -b, --basedir=name  Path to installation directory. All paths are usually
 resolved relative to this
 --big-tables        Allow big result sets by saving all temporary sets on

 --bind-address=name IP address(es) to bind to. Syntax: address[,address]...,
 where address can be an IPv4 address, IPv6 address, host
 name or one of the wildcard values *, ::, 0.0.0.0. In
 case more than one address is specified in a
 comma-separated list, wildcard values are not allowed.
 Every address can have optional network namespace
 separated by the delimiter / from the address value.
 E.g., the following value
 192.168.1.1/red,172.16.1.1/green,193.168.1.1 specifies
 three IP addresses to listen for incoming TCP connections
 two of that have to be placed in corresponding
 namespaces: the address 192.168.1.1 must be placed into
 the namespace red and the address 172.16.1.1 must be
 placed into the namespace green. Using of network
 namespace requires its support from underlying Operating
 System. Attempt to specify a network namespace for a
 platform that doesn't support it results in error during
 socket creation.
 --binlog-cache-size=# 
 The size of the transactional cache for updates to
 transactional engines for the binary log. If you often
 use transactions containing many statements, you can
 increase this to get more performance
 --binlog-checksum=name 
 Type of BINLOG_CHECKSUM_ALG. Include checksum for log
 events in the binary log. Possible values are NONE and
 CRC32; default is CRC32.
 --binlog-direct-non-transactional-updates 
 Causes updates to non-transactional engines using
 statement format to be written directly to binary log.
 Before using this option make sure that there are no
 dependencies between transactional and non-transactional
 tables such as in the statement INSERT INTO t_myisam
 SELECT * FROM t_innodb; otherwise, slaves may diverge
 from the master.
 --binlog-do-db=name Tells the master it should log updates for the specified
 database, and exclude all others not explicitly
 mentioned.
 --binlog-encryption Enable/disable binary and relay logs encryption.
 --binlog-error-action=name 
 When statements cannot be written to the binary log due
 to a fatal error, the server can either ignore the error
 and let the master continue, or abort.
 --binlog-expire-logs-seconds=# 
 If non-zero, binary logs will be purged after
 binlog_expire_logs_seconds seconds; If both this option
 and expire_logs_days are set to non-zero  values, this
 option takes priority. Purges happen at startup and at
 binary log rotation.
 --binlog-format=name 
 What form of binary logging the master will use: either
 ROW for row-based binary logging, STATEMENT for
 statement-based binary logging, or MIXED. MIXED is
 statement-based binary logging except for those
 statements where only row-based is correct: those which
 involve user-defined functions (i.e. UDFs) or the UUID()
 function; for those, row-based binary logging is
 automatically used. If NDBCLUSTER is enabled and
 binlog-format is MIXED, the format switches to row-based
 and back implicitly per each query accessing an
 NDBCLUSTER table
 --binlog-group-commit-sync-delay=# 
 The number of microseconds the server waits for the
 binary log group commit sync queue to fill before
 continuing. Default: 0. Min: 0. Max: 1000000.
 --binlog-group-commit-sync-no-delay-count=# 
 If there are this many transactions in the commit sync
 queue and the server is waiting for more transactions to
 be enqueued (as set using
 --binlog-group-commit-sync-delay), the commit procedure
 resumes.
 --binlog-gtid-simple-recovery 
 If this option is enabled, the server does not open more
 than two binary logs when initializing GTID_PURGED and
 GTID_EXECUTED, either during server restart or when
 binary logs are being purged. Enabling this option is
 useful when the server has already generated many binary
 logs without GTID events (e.g., having GTID_MODE = OFF).
 Note: If this option is enabled, GLOBAL.GTID_EXECUTED and
 GLOBAL.GTID_PURGED may be initialized wrongly in two
 cases: (1) All binary logs were generated by MySQL 5.7.5
 or older, and GTID_MODE was ON for some binary logs but
 OFF for the newest binary log. (2) The oldest existing
 binary log was generated by MySQL 5.7.5 or older, and SET
 GTID_PURGED was issued after the oldest binary log was
 generated. If a wrong set is computed in one of case (1)
 or case (2), it will remain wrong even if the server is
 later restarted with this option disabled.
 (Defaults to on; use --skip-binlog-gtid-simple-recovery to disable.)
 --binlog-ignore-db=name 
 Tells the master that updates to the given database
 should not be logged to the binary log.
 --binlog-max-flush-queue-time=# 
 The maximum time that the binary log group commit will
 keep reading transactions before it flush the
 transactions to the binary log (and optionally sync,
 depending on the value of sync_binlog).
 --binlog-order-commits 
 Issue internal commit calls in the same order as
 transactions are written to the binary log. Default is to
 order commits.
 (Defaults to on; use --skip-binlog-order-commits to disable.)
 --binlog-rotate-encryption-master-key-at-startup 
 Force binlog encryption master key rotation at startup
 --binlog-row-event-max-size=# 
 The maximum size of a row-based binary log event in
 bytes. Rows will be grouped into events smaller than this
 size if possible. The value has to be a multiple of 256.
 --binlog-row-image=name 
 Controls whether rows should be logged in 'FULL',
 'COMPLETE', 'NOBLOB' or 'MINIMAL' formats. 'FULL', means
 that all columns in the before and after image are
 logged. 'NOBLOB', means that mysqld avoids logging blob
 columns whenever possible (e.g. blob column was not
 changed or is not part of primary key). 'MINIMAL', means
 that a PK equivalent (PK columns or full row if there is
 no PK in the table) is logged in the before image, and
 only changed columns are logged in the after image.
 'COMPLETE', means that all columns in the before and only
 changed columns in the after image are logged. (Default:
 FULL).
 --binlog-row-metadata=name 
 Controls whether metadata is logged using FULL or MINIMAL
 format. FULL causes all metadata to be logged; MINIMAL
 means that only metadata actually required by slave is
 logged. Default: MINIMAL.
 --binlog-row-value-options=name 
 When set to PARTIAL_JSON, this option enables a
 space-efficient row-based binary log format for UPDATE
 statements that modify a JSON value using only the
 functions JSON_SET, JSON_REPLACE, and JSON_REMOVE. For
 such updates, only the modified parts of the JSON
 document are included in the binary log, so small changes
 of big documents may need significantly less space.
 --binlog-rows-event-max-rows[=#] 
 Max number of rows in a single rows event
 --binlog-rows-query-log-events 
 Allow writing of Rows_query_log events into binary log.
 --binlog-stmt-cache-size=#

 non-transactional engines for the binary log. If you
 often use statements updating a great number of rows, you
 can increase this to get more performance

 Maximum number of rows to keep in the writeset history.
 --binlog-transaction-dependency-tracking=name 
 Selects the source of dependency information from which
 to assess which transactions can be executed in parallel
 by the slave's multi-threaded applier. Possible values
 are COMMIT_ORDER, WRITESET and WRITESET_SESSION.
 --binlog-trx-meta-data 
 Log meta data about every trx in the binary log. This
 information is logged as a comment in a Rows_query_log
 event in JSON format.
 --block-encryption-mode=name

 to log in a transactionally safe manner. Currently, the
 disallowed statements include CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE
 inside transactions, all updates to non-transactional
 tables, and CREATE TABLE ... SELECT.
 --eq-range-index-dive-limit=#

 of doing index dives for equality ranges if the number of
 equality ranges for the index is larger than or equal to
 this number. If set to 0, index dives are always used.

 Enable the event scheduler. Possible values are ON, OFF,
 and DISABLED (keep the event scheduler completely
 deactivated, it cannot be activated run-time)
 -T, --exit-info[=#] Used for debugging. Use at your own risk.
 --expire-logs-days=# 
 If non-zero, binary logs will be purged after
 expire_logs_days days; If this option alone is set on the
 command line or in a configuration file, it overrides the
 default value for binlog-expire-logs-seconds. If both
 options are set to nonzero values,
 binlog-expire-logs-seconds takes priority. Possible
 purges happen at startup and at binary log rotation.
 --explicit-defaults-for-timestamp 
 This option causes CREATE TABLE to create all TIMESTAMP
 columns as NULL with DEFAULT NULL attribute, Without this
 option, TIMESTAMP columns are NOT NULL and have implicit
 DEFAULT clauses. The old behavior is deprecated. The
 variable can only be set by users having the SUPER
 privilege.
 (Defaults to on; use --skip-explicit-defaults-for-timestamp to disable.)
 --external-locking  Use system (external) locking (disabled by default). 
 With this option enabled you can run myisamchk to test

 compress the gtid_executed table every
 gtid_executed_compression_period transactions, as a
 special case, if variable is 0, the thread never wakes up
 to compress the gtid_executed table.
 --gtid-mode=name    Controls whether Global Transaction Identifiers (GTIDs)
 are enabled. Can be OFF, OFF_PERMISSIVE, ON_PERMISSIVE,
 or ON. OFF means that no transaction has a GTID.
 OFF_PERMISSIVE means that new transactions (committed in
 a client session using GTID_NEXT='AUTOMATIC') are not
 assigned any GTID, and replicated transactions are
 allowed to have or not have a GTID. ON_PERMISSIVE means
 that new transactions are assigned a GTID, and replicated
 transactions are allowed to have or not have a GTID. ON
 means that all transactions have a GTID. ON is required
 on a master before any slave can use
 MASTER_AUTO_POSITION=1. To safely switch from OFF to ON,
 first set all servers to OFF_PERMISSIVE, then set all
 servers to ON_PERMISSIVE, then wait for all transactions
 without a GTID to be replicated and executed on all
 servers, and finally set all servers to GTID_MODE = ON.

 --kill-conflicting-connections 
 Setting this session only flag will instruct the the
 session to kill all conflicting connections (effective
 for admin user only) for any command executed by the
 current session. The connections are killed only after
 waiting for wait_lock_timeout. Only connections holding
 the lock will be killed, but there could be more
 connections in the queue which will take the lock before
 the current session and the current session will wait for
 1 more second before aborting if the lock won't be
 granted.

 error. The argument will be treated as a decimal value
 with nanosecond precision.
 --log-bin[=name]    Configures the name prefix to use for binary log files.
 If the --log-bin option is not supplied, the name prefix
 defaults to "binlog". If the --log-bin option is supplied
 without argument, the name prefix defaults to
 "HOSTNAME-bin", where HOSTNAME is the machine's hostname.

 --skip-log-bin or --disable-log-bin option.
 --log-bin-index=name 
 File that holds the names for binary log files.
 --log-bin-trust-function-creators 
 If set to FALSE (the default), then when --log-bin is
 used, creation of a stored function (or trigger) is
 allowed only to users having the SUPER privilege and only
 if this stored function (trigger) may not break binary
 logging. Note that if ALL connections to this server
 ALWAYS use row-based binary logging, the security issues
 do not exist and the binary logging cannot break, so you
 can safely set this to TRUE
 --log-bin-use-v1-row-events 
 If equal to 1 then version 1 row events are written to a
 row based binary log.  If equal to 0, then the latest
 version of events are written.  This option is useful

 cross-database queries such as UPDATE some_db.some_table
 SET foo='bar' while having selected a different or no
 database. If you need cross database updates to work,
 make sure you have 3.23.28 or later, and use
 replicate-wild-do-table=db_name.%.
 --replicate-do-table=name 
 Tells the slave thread to restrict replication to the
 specified table. To specify more than one table, use the
 directive multiple times, once for each table. This will
 work for cross-database updates, in contrast to
 replicate-do-db.
 --replicate-ignore-db=name 
 Tells the slave thread to not replicate to the specified
 database. To specify more than one database to ignore,
 use the directive multiple times, once for each database.

 our server id. Default value is 0 (to break infinite
 loops in circular replication). Can't be set to 1 if
 --log-slave-updates is used.
 --replicate-wild-do-table=name 
 Tells the slave thread to restrict replication to the
 tables that match the specified wildcard pattern. To
 specify more than one table, use the directive multiple
 times, once for each table. This will work for
 cross-database updates. Example:
 replicate-wild-do-table=foo%.bar% will replicate only
 updates to tables in all databases that start with foo
 and whose table names start with bar.
 --replicate-wild-ignore-table=name 
 Tells the slave thread to not replicate to the tables
 that match the given wildcard pattern. To specify more
 than one table to ignore, use the directive multiple

 slave to register itself with the master. Note that it is
 not sufficient for the master to simply read the IP of
 the slave off the socket once the slave connects. Due to
 NAT and other routing issues, that IP may not be valid
 for connecting to the slave from the master or other
 hosts
 --report-password=name 
 The account password of the slave to be reported to the
 master during slave registration

 running on the master for the statement. LOGGING also
 means results of that the executed triggers work will be
 written to the binlog.
 --slave-skip-errors=name 
 Tells the slave thread to continue replication when a
 query event returns an error from the provided list
 --slave-sql-verify-checksum

 ALL_UNSIGNED. If the variable is assigned the empty set,
 no conversions are allowed and it is expected that the
 types match exactly.
 --slave-use-idempotent-for-recovery=name 
 Modes for how replication events should be executed
 during recovery. Legal values are NO (default) and YES.
 YES means replication will not stop for operations that
 are idempotent. Note that binlog format must be ROW and
