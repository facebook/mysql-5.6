 name or one of the wildcard values *, ::, 0.0.0.0. In
 case more than one address is specified in a
 comma-separated list, wildcard values are not allowed.
 Every address can have optional network namespace
 separated by the delimiter / from the address value.
 E.g., the following value
 192.168.1.1/red,172.16.1.1/green,193.168.1.1 specifies
 three IP addresses to listen for incoming TCP connections
 two of that have to be placed in corresponding
 namespaces: the address 192.168.1.1 must be placed into
 the namespace red and the address 172.16.1.1 must be
 placed into the namespace green. Using of network
 namespace requires its support from underlying Operating
 System. Attempt to specify a network namespace for a
 platform that doesn't support it results in error during
 socket creation.
 --binlog-cache-size=# 
 The size of the transactional cache for updates to
 transactional engines for the binary log. If you often
 use transactions containing many statements, you can
 increase this to get more performance
 --binlog-checksum=name 
 Type of BINLOG_CHECKSUM_ALG. Include checksum for log
 events in the binary log. Possible values are NONE and
 CRC32; default is CRC32.
 --binlog-direct-non-transactional-updates 
 Causes updates to non-transactional engines using
 statement format to be written directly to binary log,
 after executing them and before committing the
 transaction. Before using this option make sure that
 there are no dependencies between transactional and
 non-transactional tables such as in the statement INSERT
 INTO t_myisam SELECT * FROM t_innodb; otherwise, replicas
 may diverge.
 --binlog-do-db=name Include only updates to the specified database when
 writing the binary log.
 --binlog-encryption Enable/disable binary and relay logs encryption.
 --binlog-error-action=name 
 When statements cannot be written to the binary log due
 to a fatal error, this option determines whether the
 server ignores the error and closes the binary log, or
 aborts.
 --binlog-expire-logs-auto-purge 
 Controls whether the server shall automatically purge
 binary log files or not. If this variable is set to FALSE
 then the server will not purge binary log files
 automatically.
 (Defaults to on; use --skip-binlog-expire-logs-auto-purge to disable.)
 --binlog-expire-logs-seconds=# 
 If non-zero, binary logs will be purged after
 binlog_expire_logs_seconds seconds; If both this option
 and expire_logs_days are set to non-zero  values, this
 option takes priority. Purges happen at startup and at
 binary log rotation.
 --binlog-format=name 
 The format used when writing the binary log. ROW writes
 each changed row in a binary format. STATEMENT writes SQL
 statements. MIXED writes SQL statements for most
 statements, and row format for statements that cannot be
 replayed in a deterministic manner using SQL. If
 NDBCLUSTER is enabled and binlog-format is MIXED, the
 format switches to row-based and back implicitly for each
 query accessing an NDBCLUSTER table.
 --binlog-group-commit-sync-delay=# 
 The number of microseconds the server waits for the
 binary log group commit sync queue to fill before
 continuing. Default: 0. Min: 0. Max: 1000000.

 If there are this many transactions in the commit sync
 queue and the server is waiting for more transactions to
 be enqueued (as set using
 --binlog-group-commit-sync-delay), the commit procedure
 resumes.
 --binlog-gtid-simple-recovery 
 If this option is enabled, the server does not open more
 than two binary logs when initializing GTID_PURGED and
 GTID_EXECUTED, either during server restart or when
 binary logs are being purged. Enabling this option is
 useful when the server has already generated many binary
 logs without GTID events (e.g., having GTID_MODE = OFF).
 Note: If this option is enabled, GLOBAL.GTID_EXECUTED and
 GLOBAL.GTID_PURGED may be initialized wrongly in two
 cases: (1) All binary logs were generated by MySQL 5.7.5
 or older, and GTID_MODE was ON for some binary logs but
 OFF for the newest binary log. (2) The oldest existing
 binary log was generated by MySQL 5.7.5 or older, and SET
 GTID_PURGED was issued after the oldest binary log was
 generated. If a wrong set is computed in one of case (1)
 or case (2), it will remain wrong even if the server is
 later restarted with this option disabled.
 (Defaults to on; use --skip-binlog-gtid-simple-recovery to disable.)
 --binlog-ignore-db=name 
 Exclude updates to the specified database when writing
 the binary log.
 --binlog-max-flush-queue-time=# 
 The maximum time that the binary log group commit will
 keep reading transactions before it flush the
 transactions to the binary log (and optionally sync,
 depending on the value of sync_binlog).
 --binlog-order-commits 
 Issue internal commit calls in the same order as
 transactions are written to the binary log. Default is to
 order commits.

 --binlog-rotate-encryption-master-key-at-startup 
 Force binlog encryption master key rotation at startup
 --binlog-row-event-max-size=# 
 The maximum size of a row-based binary log event in
 bytes. Rows will be grouped into events smaller than this
 size if possible. The value has to be a multiple of 256.
 --binlog-row-image=name 
 Controls whether rows should be logged in 'FULL',
 'COMPLETE', 'NOBLOB' or 'MINIMAL' formats. 'FULL', means
 that all columns in the before and after image are
 logged. 'NOBLOB', means that mysqld avoids logging blob
 columns whenever possible (e.g. blob column was not
 changed or is not part of primary key). 'MINIMAL', means
 that a PK equivalent (PK columns or full row if there is
 no PK in the table) is logged in the before image, and
 only changed columns are logged in the after image.
 'COMPLETE', means that all columns in the before and only
 changed columns in the after image are logged. (Default:
 FULL).
 --binlog-row-metadata=name 
 Controls how much type information is written to the
 binary log when using ROW format. FULL causes all
 metadata to be logged. MINIMAL means that only metadata
 actually needed by replicas is logged.
 --binlog-row-value-options=name 
 When set to PARTIAL_JSON, this option enables a
 space-efficient row-based binary log format for UPDATE
 statements that modify a JSON value using only the
 functions JSON_SET, JSON_REPLACE, and JSON_REMOVE. For
 such updates, only the modified parts of the JSON
 document are included in the binary log, so small changes
 of big documents may need significantly less space.

 --binlog-rows-query-log-events 
 Allow writing of Rows_query_log events into binary log.

 to compute logical timestamps, which replicas can use to
 decide which transactions can be executed in parallel
 when using replica_parallel_type=LOGICAL_CLOCK. Possible
 values are COMMIT_ORDER, WRITESET and WRITESET_SESSION.

 tables, and CREATE TABLE ... SELECT.
 --eq-range-index-dive-limit=# 
 The optimizer will use existing index statistics instead
 of doing index dives for equality ranges if the number of

 --gap-lock-raise-error[=name] 
 Controls raising a warning or an error when executing
 queries that rely on Gap Lock. It can take the following
 values: OFF: no error is raised WARNING: a warning is
 raised ERROR: an error is raised. Default is OFF
 --gap-lock-write-log 
 Writing to gap_lock_log_file when executing queries
 relying on Gap Lock. Default is false.
 --gdb               Set up signals usable for debugging.
 --general-log       Log connections and queries to a table or log file.

 --group-replication-plugin-hooks 
 Enable interfaces and codepaths used by group replication
 plugin
 --gtid-executed-compression-period[=#] 
 Compress the mysql.gtid_executed table whenever this
 number of transactions have been added, by waking up a
 foreground thread (compress_gtid_table). This compression
 method only operates when binary logging is disabled on
 the replica; if binary logging is enabled, the table is
 compressed every time the binary log is rotated, and this
 value is ignored. Before MySQL 8.0.23, the default is
 1000, and from MySQL 8.0.23, the default is zero, which
 disables this compression method. This is because in
 releases from MySQL 8.0.17, InnoDB transactions are
 written to the mysql.gtid_executed table by a separate
 process to non-InnoDB transactions. If the server has a
 mix of InnoDB and non-InnoDB transactions, attempting to
 compress the table with the compress_gtid_table thread
 can slow this process, so from MySQL 8.0.17 it is
 recommended that you set gtid_executed_compression_period
 to 0.
 --gtid-mode=name    Controls whether Global Transaction Identifiers (GTIDs)
 are enabled. Can be OFF, OFF_PERMISSIVE, ON_PERMISSIVE,
 or ON. OFF means that no transaction has a GTID.
 OFF_PERMISSIVE means that new transactions (committed in
 a client session using GTID_NEXT='AUTOMATIC') are not
 assigned any GTID, and replicated transactions are
 allowed to have or not have a GTID. ON_PERMISSIVE means
 that new transactions are assigned a GTID, and replicated
 transactions are allowed to have or not have a GTID. ON
 means that all transactions have a GTID. ON is required
 on a source before any replica can use
 SOURCE_AUTO_POSITION=1. To safely switch from OFF to ON,
 first set all servers to OFF_PERMISSIVE, then set all
 servers to ON_PERMISSIVE, then wait for all transactions
 without a GTID to be replicated and executed on all
 servers, and finally set all servers to GTID_MODE = ON.

 --optimizer-fix-range-cost-row-threshold[=#] 
 For large tables, range scan may end up picking
 suboptimal index due to not considering 'worst_seeks' io
 cost for range scans, and ignoring the index even for ref
 plan due to 'range_uses_more_keyparts'. This variable
 changes these behaviors when estimated rows of the table
 is bigger than this value, which makes range scans for
 the index is more likely to get picked. Default is 0,
 which disables the feature.

 --optimizer-max-subgraph-pairs=# 
 Maximum depth of subgraph pairs a query can have before
 the hypergraph join optimizer starts reducing the search
 space heuristically. Larger values may result in better
 query plans for large queries, but also more time and
 memory spent during planning. Increasing this larger than
 the actual number of subgraph pairs in the query will
 have no further effect. Ignored by the old
 (non-hypergraph) join optimizer
 --optimizer-prune-level=#

 optimization to prune less-promising partial plans from
 the optimizer search space. Meaning: 0 - do not apply any

 them as soon as they are no more needed
 (Defaults to on; use --skip-relay-log-purge to disable.)
 --relay-log-recovery 
 If enabled, existing relay logs will be skipped by the
 replication threads. The receiver will start a new relay
 log and the applier will start reading from the beginning

 that it decides whether two transactions can be applied
 in parallel using the logical timestamps computed by the
 source, according to
 binlog_transaction_dependency_tracking.
 --replica-parallel-workers=# 
 Number of worker threads for executing events in parallel
 --replica-pending-jobs-size-max=#

 thread on this replica encounters one of these errors
 while applying a Query_log_event, it will ignore the
 error, rather than stop.

 reading them from relay log. Note: The replica always
 verifies checksums for events received from the network,
 if the event has a checksum at all, before it writes the
 event to the relay log. Enabled by default.

 --replica-transaction-retries=# 
 Number of times the replication applier will retry a
 transaction in case it failed with a deadlock or other
 transient error, before it gives up and stops.
 --replica-type-conversions=name 
 Set of type conversions that may be used by the
 replication applier thread for row events. Allowed values
 are: ALL_LOSSY to enable lossy conversions, ALL_NON_LOSSY
 to enable non-lossy conversions, ALL_NON_TRUNCATION to
 enable conversions between compatible types as long as
 there is no truncation in value, ALL_UNSIGNED to treat
 all integer column type data to be unsigned values, and
 ALL_SIGNED to treat all integer column type data to be
 signed values. Default treatment is ALL_SIGNED. If
 ALL_SIGNED and ALL_UNSIGNED both are specified,
 ALL_SIGNED will take higher priority than ALL_UNSIGNED.
 If the variable is assigned the empty set, no conversions
 are allowed and it is expected that the types match
 exactly.
 --replicate-do-db=name 
 Make replication applier threads apply only changes to
 the specified database. To specify more than one
 database, use the directive multiple times, once for each
 database. Note that this will only work if you do not use
 cross-database queries such as UPDATE some_db.some_table
 SET foo='bar' while having selected a different or no
 database. If you need cross database updates to work,
 make sure you have 3.23.28 or later, and use
 replicate-wild-do-table=db_name.%.
 --replicate-do-table=name 
 Make replication applier threads apply only changes to
 the specified table. To specify more than one table, use
 the directive multiple times, once for each table. This
 will work for cross-database updates, in contrast to
 replicate-do-db.
 --replicate-ignore-db=name 
 Make replication applier threads skip changes to the
 specified database. To specify more than one database to
 ignore, use this option multiple times, once for each
 database. If there are statements that update multiple
 databases, this will work correctly only when the source
 server uses binlog_format=ROW.
 --replicate-ignore-table=name 
 Make replication applier threads skip changes to the
 specified table.To ignore more than one table, use the
 option multiple times, once for each table. If there are
 statements that update multiple tables, this will work
 correctly only when the source server uses
 binlog_format=ROW.
 --replicate-rewrite-db=name 
 Make replication applier threads rename a database, so
 changes in one database on the source will be applied in
 another database on this replica. Example:
 replicate-rewrite-db=source_db_name->replica_db_name.
 --replicate-same-server-id 
 In replication, if set to 1, do not skip events having
 our server id. Default value is 0 (to break infinite
 loops in circular replication). Can't be set to 1 if
 --log-replica-updates is used.
 --replicate-wild-do-table=name 
 Make replication applier threads apply changes only in
 tables that match the specified wildcard pattern. To
 specify more than one pattern, use the option multiple
 times, once for each pattern. If there are statements
 that update both tables that are included and excluded by
 the pattern, this will only work correctly when the
 source server uses binlog_format=ROW. Example:
 replicate-wild-do-table=foo%.bar% will replicate only
 updates to tables in all databases that start with foo
 and whose table names start with bar.
 --replicate-wild-ignore-table=name 
 Make replication applier threads skip changes to tables
 that match the specified wildcard pattern. To specify
 more than one pattern, use the option multiple times,
 once for each pattern. If there are statements that
 update both tables that are included and tables that are
 excluded by the pattern, this will only work correctly
 when the source server uses binlog_format=ROW. Example:
 when using replicate-wild-ignore-table=foo%.bar%, the
 applier thread will not apply updates to tables in
 databases that start with foo and whose table names start
 with bar.
 --replication-optimize-for-static-plugin-config 
 Optional flag that blocks plugin install/uninstall and
 allows skipping the acquisition of the lock to read from
 the plugin list and the usage of read-optimized
 spin-locks. Use only when plugin hook callback needs
 optimization (a lot of semi-sync replicas, for instance).
 --replication-sender-observe-commit-only 
 Optional flag that allows for only calling back observer
 hooks at commit.
 --report-host=name  Hostname or IP that this replica will report to the
 source while initiating the replication connection. Will
 appear in the output of SHOW REPLICAS. Leave this unset
 if you do not want the replica to register itself with
 the source. Note that it is not sufficient for the source
 to simply read the IP of the replica off the socket once
 the replica connects: in the presence of NAT other
 routing features, that IP may not be valid for connecting
 to the replica from the source or other hosts.
 --report-password=name 
 The account password that this replica will report to the
 source while initiating the replication connection.
 --report-port=#     The port for connecting to the replica, which this
 replica will report to the source while initiating the
 replication connection. Set it only if the replica is
 listening on a non-default port or if you have a special
 tunnel from the source or other clients to this replica.
 If not sure, leave this option unset.
 --report-user=name  The account user name that this replica will report to
 the source while initiating the replication connection.
 --require-secure-transport 
 When this option is enabled, connections attempted using
 insecure transport will be rejected.  Secure transports
 are SSL/TLS, Unix socket or Shared Memory (on Windows).
 --reset-period-status-vars 
 Enable atomic reset of period status vars when they are
 shown.
 --reset-seconds-behind-master 
 When TRUE reset Seconds_Behind_Master to 0 when SQL
 thread catches up to the IO thread. This is the original
 behavior but also causes reported lag to flip-flop
 between 0 and the real lag when the IO thread is the
 bottleneck.

 of after image and before image for all binlog row events
 for every RW transaction thru resp attr
 'binlog_row_image_delta'

 pair - 'hlc_ts' is the key and the value is the
 stringified HLC timestamp. Note that HLC should be
 enabled by setting enable_binlog_hlc

 disables this feature
 --response-attrs-contain-server-cpu 
 If this is enabled, then the server CPU time of the query
 is sent back to clients as part of OK packet in session
 response attribute. Server CPU time is sent as a
 key-value pair - 'server_cpu' is the key and the value is
 the stringified server CPU time.
 --response-attrs-contain-warnings-bytes[=#] 
 Specifies the size of the warnings information (specified
 in bytes)  that can be included in the query response
 attributes. The warnings are sent as a key-value pair -
 'warnings' is the key and the value is a list of pairs
 included with in brackets separated by commas. The first
 value of the pair is the error number (code) and the
 second  value of the pair is the message text and these
 are separated by a comma. The default value is 0 which
 disables this feature
 --response-attrs-contain-write-tables-bytes[=#] 
 Specifies the size of the tables information (specified
 in bytes) that can be included in the query response
 attributes. The tables are sent as a key-value pair -
 'write_tables' is the key and the value is a list of
 table names separated by commas. The default value is 0
 which disables this feature

 value is 0, which means all compactions are under
 concurrency of rocksdb_max_background_compactions|jobs.
 If you set very low
 rocksdb_max_bottom_pri_background_compactions (e.g. 1 or

 Percent of secondaries that need to lag for overall
 replication topology to be considered lagging
 --write-throttle-min-ratio[=#] 
 Minimum value of the ratio (1st entity)/(2nd entity) for
 replication lag throttling to kick in
 --write-throttle-monitor-cycles[=#] 
 Number of consecutive cycles to monitor an entity for
 replication lag throttling before taking action
 --write-throttle-patterns[=name] 
 This variable is used to throttle write requests based on
 user name, client id, sql_id or shard. It is used to
 manually mitigate replication lag related issues.Check
 out I_S.write_throttling_rules for all active rules.Valid
 values - OFF, [+-][CLIENT|USER|SHARD|SQL_ID]=<value>
 --write-throttle-permissible-dimensions-in-order[=name] 
 All the dimensions(SQL_ID, CLIENT, USER, SHARD) that are
 permitted to beauto throttled in order in case of
 replication lag.
 --write-throttle-rate-step[=#] 
 This variable determines the step by which throttle rate
 probability is incremented or decremented. Default value
 is 100 which means an entity is either fully throttled or
 not throttled at all
 --write-throttle-tag-only 
 If set to true, replication lag throttling will only
 throttle queries with query attribute mt_throttle_okay.
 --write-time-check-batch[=#] 
 Frequency (specified in number of rows) of checking
 whether the CPU time of DML queries exceeded the limit
 enforced by write_cpu_limit_milliseconds.
 --xa-detach-on-prepare 
 When set, XA transactions will be detached (AKA
 dissociated or disconnected) from connection as part of
 XA PREPARE. This means that the XA transaction can be
 committed/rolled back by any connection, even if the
 starting connection has not terminated, and the starting
 connection can start new transactions. As a side effect,
 temporary tables cannot be used inside XA transactions.
 When disabled, XA transactions are associated with the
 same connection until the session disconnects. ON is the
 only safe choice for replication.
 (Defaults to on; use --skip-xa-detach-on-prepare to disable.)
 --zstd-net-compression-level[=#] 
 Compression level for compressed protocol when zstd
 library is selected.
