 without corresponding xxx_init() or xxx_deinit(). That
 also means that one can load any function from any
 library, for example exit() from libc.so

 will also set transaction isolation level 'serializable'.
 --async-query-counter 
 Parsing async query info and collection of async query
 statistics
 --auto-increment-increment[=#] 
 Auto-increment columns are incremented by this
 --auto-increment-offset[=#] 
 Offset added to Auto-increment columns. Used when
 auto-increment-increment != 1
 --autocommit        Set default value for autocommit (0 or 1)
 (Defaults to on; use --skip-autocommit to disable.)
 --automatic-sp-privileges 
 Creating and dropping stored procedures alters ACLs
 (Defaults to on; use --skip-automatic-sp-privileges to disable.)
 --avoid-temporal-upgrade 
 When this option is enabled, the pre-5.6.4 temporal types
 are not upgraded to the new format for ALTER TABLE
 requests ADD/CHANGE/MODIFY COLUMN, ADD INDEX or FORCE
 operation. This variable is deprecated and will be
 removed in a future release.

 --binlog-cache-size=# 
 The size of the transactional cache for updates to
 transactional engines for the binary log. If you often
 use transactions containing many statements, you can
 increase this to get more performance

 Type of BINLOG_CHECKSUM_ALG. Include checksum for log
 events in the binary log. Possible values are NONE and
 CRC32; default is NONE.
 --binlog-direct-non-transactional-updates 
 Causes updates to non-transactional engines using
 statement format to be written directly to binary log.
 Before using this option make sure that there are no
 dependencies between transactional and non-transactional
 tables such as in the statement INSERT INTO t_myisam
 SELECT * FROM t_innodb; otherwise, slaves may diverge
 from the master.
 --binlog-do-db=name Tells the master it should log updates for the specified
 database, and exclude all others not explicitly
 mentioned.

 startup and at binary log rotation
 --binlog-format=name 
 What form of binary logging the master will use: either
 ROW for row-based binary logging, STATEMENT for
 statement-based binary logging, or MIXED. MIXED is
 statement-based binary logging except for those
 statements where only row-based is correct: those which
 involve user-defined functions (i.e. UDFs) or the UUID()
 function; for those, row-based binary logging is
 automatically used. If NDBCLUSTER is enabled and
 binlog-format is MIXED, the format switches to row-based
 and back implicitly per each query accessing an
 NDBCLUSTER table
 --binlog-gtid-simple-recovery 
 If this option is enabled, the server does not open more
 than two binary logs when initializing GTID_PURGED and
 GTID_EXECUTED, either during server restart or when
 binary logs are being purged. Enabling this option is
 useful when the server has already generated many binary
 logs without GTID events (e.g., having GTID_MODE = OFF).
 Note: If this option is enabled, GLOBAL.GTID_EXECUTED and
 GLOBAL.GTID_PURGED may be initialized wrongly in two
 cases: (1) GTID_MODE was ON for some binary logs but OFF
 for the newest binary log. (2) SET GTID_PURGED was issued
 after the oldest existing binary log was generated. If a
 wrong set is computed in one of case (1) or case (2), it
 will remain wrong even if the server is later restarted
 with this option disabled.
 --binlog-ignore-db=name 
 Tells the master that updates to the given database
 should not be logged to the binary log.
 --binlog-order-commits 
 Issue internal commit calls in the same order as
 transactions are written to the binary log. Default is to
 order commits.
 (Defaults to on; use --skip-binlog-order-commits to disable.)
 --binlog-row-event-max-size=# 
 The maximum size of a row-based binary log event in
 bytes. Rows will be grouped into events smaller than this
 size if possible. The value has to be a multiple of 256.
 --binlog-row-image=name 
 Controls whether rows should be logged in 'FULL',
 'COMPLETE','NOBLOB' or 'MINIMAL' formats. 'FULL', means
 that all columns in the before and after image are
 logged. 'COMPLETE', means that all columns in the before
 and only changed columns in the after image are
 logged.'NOBLOB', means that mysqld avoids logging blob
 columns whenever possible (eg, blob column was not
 changed or is not part of primary key). 'MINIMAL', means
 that a PK equivalent (PK columns or full row if there is
 no PK in the table) is logged in the before image, and
 only changed columns are logged in the after image.
 (Default: FULL).
 --binlog-rows-event-max-rows[=#] 
 Max number of rows in a single rows event
 --binlog-rows-query-log-events 
 Allow writing of Rows_query_log events into binary log.
 --binlog-stmt-cache-size=#

 Log meta data about every trx in the binary log. This
 information is logged as a comment in a Rows_query_log
 event in JSON format.
 --binlogging-impossible-mode=name 
 On a fatal error when statements cannot be binlogged the
 behaviour can be ignore the error and let the master
 continue or abort the server. This variable is deprecated
 and will be removed in a future release. Please use
 binlog_error_action instead.

 Note that this will only work if you do not use
 cross-database queries such as UPDATE some_db.some_table
 SET foo='bar' while having selected a different or no
 database. If you need cross database updates to work,
 make sure you have 3.23.28 or later, and use
 replicate-wild-do-table=db_name.%.
 --replicate-do-table=name 
 Tells the slave thread to restrict replication to the
 specified table. To specify more than one table, use the
 directive multiple times, once for each table. This will
 work for cross-database updates, in contrast to
 replicate-do-db.
 --replicate-ignore-db=name 
 Tells the slave thread to not replicate to the specified
 database. To specify more than one database to ignore,
 use the directive multiple times, once for each database.
 This option will not work if you use cross database
 updates. If you need cross database updates to work, make
 sure you have 3.23.28 or later, and use
 replicate-wild-ignore-table=db_name.%. 
 --replicate-ignore-table=name 
 Tells the slave thread to not replicate to the specified
 table. To specify more than one table to ignore, use the
 directive multiple times, once for each table. This will

 original. Example:
 replicate-rewrite-db=master_db_name->slave_db_name.
 --replicate-same-server-id

 our server id. Default value is 0 (to break infinite
 loops in circular replication). Can't be set to 1 if
 --log-slave-updates is used.
 --replicate-wild-do-table=name 
 Tells the slave thread to restrict replication to the
 tables that match the specified wildcard pattern. To
 specify more than one table, use the directive multiple
 times, once for each table. This will work for
 cross-database updates. Example:
 replicate-wild-do-table=foo%.bar% will replicate only
 updates to tables in all databases that start with foo
 and whose table names start with bar.
 --replicate-wild-ignore-table=name 
 Tells the slave thread to not replicate to the tables
 that match the given wildcard pattern. To specify more
 than one table to ignore, use the directive multiple
 times, once for each table. This will work for
 cross-database updates. Example:
 replicate-wild-ignore-table=foo%.bar% will not do updates
 to tables in databases that start with foo and whose
 table names start with bar.
 --report-host=name  Hostname or IP of the slave to be reported to the master
 during slave registration. Will appear in the output of
 SHOW SLAVE HOSTS. Leave unset if you do not want the
 slave to register itself with the master. Note that it is
 not sufficient for the master to simply read the IP of
 the slave off the socket once the slave connects. Due to
 NAT and other routing issues, that IP may not be valid
 for connecting to the slave from the master or other
 hosts
 --report-password=name 
 The account password of the slave to be reported to the
 master during slave registration
 --report-port=#     Port for connecting to slave reported to the master
 during slave registration. Set it only if the slave is
 listening on a non-default port or if you have a special
 tunnel from the master or other clients to the slave. If
 not sure, leave this option unset
 --report-user=name  The account user name of the slave to be reported to the
 master during slave registration
 --reset-seconds-behind-master 
 When TRUE reset Seconds_Behind_Master to 0 when SQL
 thread catches up to the IO thread. This is the original
 behavior but also causes reported lag to flip-flop
 between 0 and the real lag when the IO thread is the
 bottleneck.
 (Defaults to on; use --skip-reset-seconds-behind-master to disable.)
 --response-attrs-contain-hlc 
 If this is enabled, then the HLC timestamp of a RW
 transaction is sent back to clients as part of OK packet
 in session response attribute. HLC is sent as a key-value
 pair - 'hlc_ts' is the key and the value is the
 stringified HLC timestamp. Note that HLC should be
 enabled by setting enable_binlog_hlc

 SUPER privilege
 -s, --symbolic-links 
 Enable symbolic link support.
 --sync-binlog=#     Synchronously flush binary log to disk after every #th

 Synchronously flush relay log info to disk after every
 #th transaction. Use 0 to disable synchronous flushing
 --sysdate-is-now    Non-default option to alias SYSDATE() to NOW() to make it
 safe-replicable. Since 5.0, SYSDATE() returns a `dynamic'
 value different for different invocations, even within
 the same statement.
 --table-definition-cache=# 
 The number of cached table definitions
 --table-open-cache=# 
 The number of cached open tables (total for all table
 cache instances)

 exceeded. 0 means no limit.
 --tmp-table-size=#  If an internal in-memory temporary table exceeds this
 size, MySQL will automatically convert it to an on-disk
 MyISAM table
 -t, --tmpdir=name   Path for temporary files. Several paths may be specified,
 separated by a colon (:), in this case they are used in a
 round-robin fashion
 --transaction-alloc-block-size=# 
 Allocation block size for transactions to be stored in
 binary log
 --transaction-isolation=name 
 Default transaction isolation level.
 --transaction-prealloc-size=# 
 Persistent buffer for transactions to be stored in binary
 log
 --transaction-read-only 
 Default transaction access mode. True if transactions are
 read-only.
 --trim-binlog-to-recover

 (usually get from GUI tools)
 --use-cached-table-stats-ptr 
 Controls the use of the cached table_stats ptr in the
 handler object
 --use-db-uuid       If set, MySQL uses database UUID while generating the

 database must be set either while creating the database
 or using an alter command. If no UUID is associated with
 a database, server_uuid is used.
 --use-fbson-input-format 
 Uses FBSON format as document type input. This session
 value is set to true for SQL threads when inserting
 document fields received through row based replication.
 --use-fbson-output-format 
 Uses FBSON format as document type output.
 --use-lock-sharding Use sharding to reduce contention on certain
 high-contention locks
