 Switch to allow/deny reads and writes to a table not in
 the current database.
 --allow-suspicious-udfs 
 Allows use of UDFs consisting of only one symbol xxx()
 without corresponding xxx_init() or xxx_deinit(). That
 also means that one can load any function from any
 library, for example exit() from libc.so
 -a, --ansi          Use ANSI SQL syntax instead of MySQL syntax. This mode
 will also set transaction isolation level 'serializable'.
 --auto-increment-increment[=#] 
 Auto-increment columns are incremented by this
 --auto-increment-offset[=#] 
 Offset added to Auto-increment columns. Used when
 auto-increment-increment != 1
 --autocommit        Set default value for autocommit (0 or 1)

 requests ADD/CHANGE/MODIFY COLUMN, ADD INDEX or FORCE
 operation. This variable is deprecated and will be
 removed in a future release.

 have. This comes into play when the main MySQL thread
 gets very many connection requests in a very short time

 file (Solves most 'table full' errors)
 --bind-address=name IP address to bind to.
 --binlog-cache-size=# 
 The size of the transactional cache for updates to
 transactional engines for the binary log. If you often
 use transactions containing many statements, you can
 increase this to get more performance

 Type of BINLOG_CHECKSUM_ALG. Include checksum for log
 events in the binary log. Possible values are NONE and
 CRC32; default is NONE.
 --binlog-direct-non-transactional-updates 
 Causes updates to non-transactional engines using
 statement format to be written directly to binary log.
 Before using this option make sure that there are no
 dependencies between transactional and non-transactional
 tables such as in the statement INSERT INTO t_myisam
 SELECT * FROM t_innodb; otherwise, slaves may diverge
 from the master.
 --binlog-do-db=name Tells the master it should log updates for the specified
 database, and exclude all others not explicitly
 mentioned.
 --binlog-error-action=name 
 When statements cannot be written to the binary log due
 to a fatal error, the server can either ignore the error
 and let the master continue, or abort.
 --binlog-format=name 
 What form of binary logging the master will use: either
 ROW for row-based binary logging, STATEMENT for
 statement-based binary logging, or MIXED. MIXED is
 statement-based binary logging except for those
 statements where only row-based is correct: those which
 involve user-defined functions (i.e. UDFs) or the UUID()
 function; for those, row-based binary logging is
 automatically used. If NDBCLUSTER is enabled and
 binlog-format is MIXED, the format switches to row-based
 and back implicitly per each query accessing an
 NDBCLUSTER table
 --binlog-gtid-simple-recovery 
 If this option is enabled, the server does not scan more
 than one binary log for every iteration when initializing
 GTID sets on server restart. Enabling this option is very
 useful when restarting a server which has already
 generated lots of binary logs without GTID events. Note:
 If this option is enabled, GLOBAL.GTID_EXECUTED and
 GLOBAL.GTID_PURGED cannot be initialized correctly if
 binary log(s) with GTID events were generated before
 binary log(s) without GTID events, for example if
 gtid_mode is disabled when the server has already
 generated binary log(s) with GTID events and not purged
 them.
 --binlog-ignore-db=name 
 Tells the master that updates to the given database
 should not be logged to the binary log.

 transactions are written to the binary log. Default is to
 order commits.
 (Defaults to on; use --skip-binlog-order-commits to disable.)
 --binlog-row-event-max-size=# 
 The maximum size of a row-based binary log event in
 bytes. Rows will be grouped into events smaller than this
 size if possible. The value has to be a multiple of 256.
 --binlog-row-image=name 
 Controls whether rows should be logged in 'FULL',
 'NOBLOB' or 'MINIMAL' formats. 'FULL', means that all
 columns in the before and after image are logged.
 'NOBLOB', means that mysqld avoids logging blob columns
 whenever possible (eg, blob column was not changed or is
 not part of primary key). 'MINIMAL', means that a PK
 equivalent (PK columns or full row if there is no PK in
 the table) is logged in the before image, and only
 changed columns are logged in the after image. (Default:
 FULL).
 --binlog-rows-query-log-events 
 Allow writing of Rows_query_log events into binary log.
 --binlog-stmt-cache-size=# 
 The size of the statement cache for updates to
 non-transactional engines for the binary log. If you
 often use statements updating a great number of rows, you
 can increase this to get more performance
 --binlogging-impossible-mode=name 
 On a fatal error when statements cannot be binlogged the
 behaviour can be ignore the error and let the master
 continue or abort the server. This variable is deprecated
 and will be removed in a future release. Please use
 binlog_error_action instead.

 exception for replication (slave) threads and users with
 the SUPER privilege
 --read-only-slave   Blocks disabling read_only if the server is a slave. This

 on a slave. Slave with read_only=0 may generate new GTID
 on its own breaking replication or may cause a split
 brain.

 use the directive multiple times, once for each database.
 Note that this will only work if you do not use
 cross-database queries such as UPDATE some_db.some_table
 SET foo='bar' while having selected a different or no
 database. If you need cross database updates to work,
 make sure you have 3.23.28 or later, and use
 replicate-wild-do-table=db_name.%.
 --replicate-do-table=name 
 Tells the slave thread to restrict replication to the
 specified table. To specify more than one table, use the
 directive multiple times, once for each table. This will
 work for cross-database updates, in contrast to
 replicate-do-db.
 --replicate-ignore-db=name 
 Tells the slave thread to not replicate to the specified
 database. To specify more than one database to ignore,
 use the directive multiple times, once for each database.

 sure you have 3.23.28 or later, and use
 replicate-wild-ignore-table=db_name.%. 
 --replicate-ignore-table=name 
 Tells the slave thread to not replicate to the specified

 our server id. Default value is 0 (to break infinite
 loops in circular replication). Can't be set to 1 if
 --log-slave-updates is used.
 --replicate-wild-do-table=name 
 Tells the slave thread to restrict replication to the
 tables that match the specified wildcard pattern. To
 specify more than one table, use the directive multiple
 times, once for each table. This will work for
 cross-database updates. Example:
 replicate-wild-do-table=foo%.bar% will replicate only
 updates to tables in all databases that start with foo
 and whose table names start with bar.
 --replicate-wild-ignore-table=name 
 Tells the slave thread to not replicate to the tables
 that match the given wildcard pattern. To specify more
 than one table to ignore, use the directive multiple
 times, once for each table. This will work for
 cross-database updates. Example:
 replicate-wild-ignore-table=foo%.bar% will not do updates
 to tables in databases that start with foo and whose
 table names start with bar.
 --report-host=name  Hostname or IP of the slave to be reported to the master

 the slave off the socket once the slave connects. Due to
 NAT and other routing issues, that IP may not be valid
 for connecting to the slave from the master or other
 hosts
 --report-password=name 
 The account password of the slave to be reported to the
 master during slave registration
 --report-port=#     Port for connecting to slave reported to the master

 not sure, leave this option unset
 --report-user=name  The account user name of the slave to be reported to the
 master during slave registration
 --reset-seconds-behind-master

 Raise an error when this is exceeded. 0 means no limit.
 --tmp-table-rpl-max-file-size=# 
 The max size of a file to use for a temporary table for
 replication threads. Raise an error when this is
 exceeded. 0 means no limit.
 --tmp-table-size=#  If an internal in-memory temporary table exceeds this
 size, MySQL will automatically convert it to an on-disk
 MyISAM table
 -t, --tmpdir=name   Path for temporary files. Several paths may be specified,
 separated by a colon (:), in this case they are used in a
 round-robin fashion
 --transaction-alloc-block-size=# 
 Allocation block size for transactions to be stored in
 binary log
 --transaction-isolation=name 
 Default transaction isolation level.
 --transaction-prealloc-size=# 
 Persistent buffer for transactions to be stored in binary
 log
 --transaction-read-only 
 Default transaction access mode. True if transactions are
 read-only.
 --updatable-views-with-limit=name 
 YES = Don't issue an error message (warning only) if a
