ERROR HY000: Using Gap Lock without full unique key in multi-table or multi-statement transactions is not allowed. You need either 1: Execute 'SET SESSION gap_lock_raise_error=0' if you are sure that your application does not rely on Gap Lock. 2: Rewrite queries to use all unique key columns in WHERE equal conditions. 3: Rewrite to single-table, single-statement transaction.  Query: delete from t1 where id=1
