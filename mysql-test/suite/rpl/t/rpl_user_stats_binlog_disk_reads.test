# Test IS.user_statistics for binlog_disk_reads
#

# binlog_disk_reads counts how many time (*read_function) is called by
# my_b_read() which is called by mysql_binlog_send(). It measures the
# disk reads from binlog when master replicates data to slaves. The
# number varies on different configurations. This test verifies that
# binlog_disk_reads should be increasing by comparing 2 runs.
