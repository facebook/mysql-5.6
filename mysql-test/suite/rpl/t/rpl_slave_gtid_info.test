# This test verifies the functionality of slave_gtid_info table.
# A gtid from the future is inserted into the mysql.slave_gtid_info
# and slave is expected to skip transactions with gtids less
# than the committed gtid in slave_gtid_info.

# verify slave continues doing xid commits after it skipped
# executing some transactions.
