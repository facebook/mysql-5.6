# This test is to test if mysqld can dump a core without large memory buffers.
# See opt file for the config:
#   (1) --innodb-dump-core-without-large-mem-buf is set
#   (2) the buffer pool is set to be large so that without dropping the large
#       memory buffers the core size will be much greater than 3.5GB (the actual
#       core size is less than 3GB now but set the limit to 3.5GB here in case
#       the memory footprint increases in the future)
