### (0.1) Without pirmary key: Locks on all rows
set autocommit=0;
SELECT * from t0 where id = 1 FOR UPDATE;
id	x
1	1
set autocommit=0;
lock will skip
SELECT * from t0 where id >= 0 FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED;
id	x
lock will skip
SELECT * from t0 order by id FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED;
id	x
lock will not wait, expecting error
SELECT * from t0 where id = 1 FOR UPDATE NOWAIT;
