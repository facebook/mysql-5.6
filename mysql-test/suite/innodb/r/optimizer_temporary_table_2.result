# Test for bug#96236 "Big intrinsic tmp InnoDB table make InnoDB
# engine get totally stuck".
#
# Check that InnoDB buffer pool size is set to minimum/5Mb and thus is
# small enough to trigger original problem. If it ever changes the size
# of source table below needs to be changed proportionately.

# Run query that creates big intrinsic temporary table. Prior to the
# fix it has exhausted buffer pool by keeping all its pages buffer
# fixed in memory, so query stalled.
#
# Note that to trigger problematic scenario query must perform scan
# over <auto_key0> secondary key on intrinsic temporary table
# (and auxiliary lookups to confirm record status on clustered key).
# In this case the secondary key scan fixes and unfixes pages
# through which it iterates, while pages accessed during auxiliary
# lookups on clustered key stay buffer fixed until mtr commit.
#
# In cases when intrinsic temporary table is read using clustered
# key only the problem didn't occur, as similary to previous case
# key scan fixes and unfixes pages through which it iterates, but
# there are no auxiliary lookups to buffer fix additional pages.
