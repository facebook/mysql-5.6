# Further explanation: 
# The fix for correctly returning KEY_NOT_FOUND for stale secondary keys
# (that had been concurrently updated by another transaction) involves
# comparing secondary key with a fresh copy of the SK built from newly 
# read record. The newly read record does rely on the read_set bitmap. 
# Depending on the query, all fields may not get copied into the record
# from which the 'fresh' copy of SK gets built. This can cause simple
# comparisons to fail for the SELECT .. FOR SHARE case without the fix. 
# The fix makes sure that the entire record is read by ignoring the 
# read_set bitmap.

# next, run the above tests a second time without explicitly defining
# the primary key. this tests scenarios around hidden PK.
