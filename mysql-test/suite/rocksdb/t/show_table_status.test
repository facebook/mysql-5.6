  Note that the Data_length and Avg_row_length columns may change as RocksDB
  and MyRocks mature, so this test may need to be re-recorded any time data
  format or compression type changes.  There is not a single right value for
  Data_length, but if it unexpectedly changes by a large amount it might be
  worth it to investigate to understand why.;
