#
# This file contains bootstrap test cases that
# need to be run with a debug build. See also the
# test file 'dd_bootstrap.test' for test cases
# that can be run with a non-debug server build.
#
# Preparation: Shut server down.
#
# 1. Try restart after setting an invalid version.
# ------------------------------------------------
# 1.1 Create bootstrap file.
# 1.2 First start the server with --initialize, and update the version.
# 1.3 Restart the server against DDIR - should fail.
# 1.4 Look for error.
#     Data Dictionary initialization error found 1 times.
# 1.5 Delete bootstrap file and datadir.
# 1.6 Delete log file.
#
# 2. Try restart after dropping the properties table.
# ---------------------------------------------------
# 2.1 Create bootstrap file.
# 2.2 First start the server with --initialize, and drop the properties table. Should fail.
# 2.3 Look for error.
#     Data Dictionary initialization error found 1 times.
# 2.4 Delete bootstrap file and datadir.
# 2.5 Delete log file.
#
# 3. Try restart after dropping the tables table.
# -----------------------------------------------
# 3.1 Create bootstrap file.
# 3.2 First start the server with --initialize, and drop the tables table: Should fail.
# 3.3 Look for error.
#     Data Dictionary initialization error found 1 times.
# 3.4 Delete bootstrap file and datadir.
# 3.5 Delete log file.
#
# 5. Try to access a DD table in an init-file during --initialize.
# ----------------------------------------------------------------
# 5.1 Create bootstrap file.
# 5.2 First start the server with --initialize, and submit the init file.
# 5.3 Look for error.
#     Data Dictionary table access error found 1 times.
# 5.4 Delete bootstrap file and datadir.
# 5.5 Delete log file.
#
# 6. Try to access a DD table in an init-file during plain restart.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------
# 6.1 Create bootstrap file.
# 6.2 First start the server with --initialize.
# 6.3 Restart the server against DDIR with an init-file.
# 6.4 An init file error does not make the server exit, so we need to stop the server.
# 6.5 Look for error.
#     Data Dictionary initialization error found 1 times.
# 6.6 Delete bootstrap file and datadir.
# 6.7 Delete log file.
#
# 7. Try initialize and start with --require-primary-key
#
# Bug#17468242/Wl#11807: Provide an option to prevent creation of tables
# without a unique/pk
#
# Check that this option can be set on command line without compromising
# bootstrap
# ------------------------------------------------------
# 7.1 Create bootstrap file.
# 7.2 First start the server with --initialize
# 7.3 Restart the server against DDIR.
# 7.4 Connect as root.
CREATE TABLE t1(i INT);
ERROR HY000: Unable to create or change a table without a primary key, when the system variable 'sql_require_primary_key' is set. Add a primary key to the table or unset this variable to avoid this message. Note that tables without a primary key can cause performance problems in row-based replication, so please consult your DBA before changing this setting.
# 7.5 Shut server down.
# 7.6 Close the test connection.
# 7.7 Delete bootstrap file, log file and datadir.
# ------------------------------------------------------
# Check that this option can be set on command line without
# compromising restart against the normal datadir, without
# initialize
# ------------------------------------------------------
# 8.1 Restart the server without initialize against the normal datadir
# 8.2 Connect as root.
# Verify that the system variable is in effect

# Cleanup: Restarting the server against default datadir.
