--echo FIXME!! This isn't necessarily a bug but it is confusing!
--echo The results of "is [not] null" with / without document key enabled can
--echo be different. The reason is that, with document keys disabled, there are
--echo no type for `doc11`.`bool` so as long as the document path exists and
--echo its value is not null, it will be treated as not null. But when document
--echo kyes are enabled, document path `doc11`.`bool` may pick up a type from
--echo document keys, e.g. Boolean type, and the document path values will be
--echo retrieved from that index instead of the original document, so even the
--echo value of the document path is not null in the document but it still can
--echo be null as Boolean type in index. e.g. {"bool":"key as bool will be null"},
--echo so different results will be observed with the same query.
